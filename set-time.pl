# sets mtime and atime of files to the latest commit time in git
#
# This is useful for serving static content (managed by git)
# from a cluster of identically configured HTTP servers.  HTTP
# clients and content delivery networks can get consistent
# Last-Modified headers no matter which HTTP server in the
# cluster they hit.  This should improve caching behavior.
#
# This does not take into account merges, but if you're updating
# every machine in the cluster from the same commit (A) to the
# same commit (B), the mtimes will be _consistent_ across all
# machines if not necessarily accurate.
#
# THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO OPTIMIZE BUILD SYSTEMS SUCH AS 'make'
# YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

# e.g.
#  * git set-file-times 
#  * git set-file-times --since 2020/06/17
